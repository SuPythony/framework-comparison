A collection of apps built with different frameworks using the same styles.

## Running locally

1. Download the source code.
2. Choose which app you want to run and go to its directory.
3. The svelte app lives in `svelte-app` and the react app lives in `react-app` and the alpine app lives in `alpine-app`.
4. You can run the svelte app by going into its directory and running the command `npm run dev`. Then open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see it in action.
5. You can run the react app by going into its directory and running the command `npm start`. Then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.
6. You can run the alpine app by directly opening the `index.html` file.
