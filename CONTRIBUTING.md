1. If you are creating a svelte app, start it using the `npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app` command inside the specific app directory.
2. If you are creating a react app, start it using the `npx create-react-app react-app` command inside the specific app directory.
3. If you are creating an alpine app, start with `index.html` and `main.css` files and import it using the CDN.
4. Use the same styles in all the apps. As svelte adds some extra styles, you can add some extra bit of CSS in the other apps to make it look consistent.
5. Don't use any external packages.
